# NumAlgo
**NumAlgo** is a toolkit of numerical algorithms implemented from scratch in Python — built to explore the foundations of scientific computing. It covers arbitrary-precision arithmetic, interpolation methods, matrix algorithms, optimization techniques, and more. This is coursework for the course **CS-3220: Numerical Algorithms & Optimization**.

## Features

### Classes
- **Arbitrary Precision Data Structure**
- **Matrix Class** (supports real and complex values)
- **Polynomial Class** (supports real and complex coefficients)

### Arithmetic
- **Computation of π (Pi)** using multiple series (Ramanujan, Euler, Madhava, etc):  
- **Approximations of Mathematical Functions** (sin, cos, logarithm)

### Interpolation
- **Lagrange Interpolation**  
- **Newton Interpolation** using divided differences
- **Hermite Interpolation** using derivative information
